Our team project for the SFU Stormhacks 2025 is a simple platform game. In the spirit of the hackathon, our team has challenged ourselves to try something absolutely new. This is our first attempt at making a game and we are excited to learn. This project uses Unity as the game engine with C#.
 
 Things we have learned:
